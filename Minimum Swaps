Given an array of integers A and an integer B, find and return the minimum number of swaps required to bring all the numbers less than or equal to B together.

Note: It is possible to swap any two elements, not necessarily consecutive.



Problem Constraints

1 <= length of the array <= 100000
-109 <= A[i], B <= 109



Input Format

The first argument given is the integer array A.
The second argument given is the integer B.



Output Format

Return the minimum number of swaps.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [1, 12, 10, 3, 14, 10, 5]
 B = 8
Input 2:

 A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
 B = 20


Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 1


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 A = [1, 12, 10, 3, 14, 10, 5]
 After swapping  12 and 3, A => [1, 3, 10, 12, 14, 10, 5].
 After swapping  the first occurence of 10 and 5, A => [1, 3, 5, 12, 14, 10, 10].
 Now, all elements less than or equal to 8 are together.
Explanation 2:

 A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
 After swapping 100 and 11, A => [5, 17, 11, 100].
 Now, all elements less than or equal to 20 are together.
 ///////////////////////////////////
 First, count the number of elements <= B. Let the count comes out to be X.

Create a window of first X elements. To find the number of swaps to bring all elements <= B together in the first window,
you just need to find count of elements > B in first window.
So, count of swaps required in 1 window = count of elements greater than B in that window.

For every window, find the count of elements greater than B, using sliding window technique.

First, find the number of elements that are less than or equal to B. Let the count comes out to be X.
Maintain a window of X and check how many elements we need to swap so that all X elements come in that window.

We store the minimum of all that and return that.
