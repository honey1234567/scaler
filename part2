Q] A spider is trying to build a web for itself. The web built by it doubles every day.

If the spider entirely built the web in 15 days, how many days did it take for the spider to build 25% of the web?
ANS-
Given that Spider doubles its work every day let’s figure out the amount of work done till the 14th day ( a day before 15 days ).
Let’s say the work done till the 14th day is X. Spider doubled the work done till the 14th on 15th. On day 15th, Spider did X more work.

We know that 2X = 100% work.
Which means X = 50% work.

The Spider built 50% of the web till the 14th day.
If you extend it, the Spider did 25% of the work till the 13th day.

Q) In a country where everyone wants a boy, each family continues having babies till they have a boy. After a long time, what is the proportion of boys to girls in the country? (Assuming probability of having a boy or a girl is the same) > Round off your answer to two decimal places and output the answer as I.xx where I is the integer part of your answer, and xx is the first two decimal places of the rounded-off answer.
We have been given that the probability of having a Girl or a Boy is the same i.e.
Probability(Boy) = 0.5, Probability(Girl) = 0.5

Now considering cases from the start (we will stop as soon as a boy is born).

B (First child boy, no need to have more babies)

GB (First child girl, second boy) & so on…
GGB
GGGB
GGGGB
GGGGGB
.
.
.
GGGGGG…(N - 1 times) then Boy

Success = Boy being born

Now for success probability, we need to calculate probability until the boy is born.

First Case: Total Probability = Probability(Boy) = 1/2
Second Case: Total Probability = Probability(1 Girl) * Probability(Boy) = 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4 = 1/2^2
Third Case: Total Probability = Probability(2 Girls) * Probability(Boy) = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 = 1/2^3
Fourth Case: Total Probability = Probability(3 Girls) * Probability(Boy) = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/16 = 1/2^4
.
.
.
.
so on

Adding all cases will give us the overall success probability after a long time = Answer

1/2^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/2^3 + 1/2^4…infinite times

Clearly, its a GP

Sum of infinite terms of GP = first term/(1 - common ratio)
                                                           = (1/2) / (1 - 1/2)
                                                           = 1 (Answer)

NOTE: Write the answer as 1.00 as per the question requirements

Q) One hundred people are standing in a circle in an order 1 to 100.

No.1 has a sword. He kills the next person (i.e., no. 2) and gives the sword to the next (i.e., no. 3). All person does the same until only one survives.

Which number survives at last?

1. Bring the N (Total no'' of alive persons) to closest power of 2.
2. Then find the no'' of persons were killed (i.e N-closest power of 2 value).
3. After finding the no'' of kills then we have to find the final person who is alive by using formula 2*i+1
    (where i is no'' of kills).

Example:
 Let us consider the given alive people is N=100.
Here the closest power of 2 is 64.
Then finding the no'' of kills i= 100-64 =36.
By substituting these values into above formula, i.e 2*i+1
2*36+1=73.
:. Hence for all 100 people the only person who alive in the final is 73.
