Given an integer A. Unset B bits from the right of A in binary.

For example, if A = 93 and B = 4, the binary representation of A is 1011101.
If we unset the rightmost 4 bits, we get the binary number 1010000, which is equal to the decimal value 80.





MINE(as per lecture)
public class Solution {
    public long solve(long A, int B) {
        long ans = A;
        for(long i=0;i<B;i++){
              ans = ((~(1<<i)) & ans);
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
OR
Initialise a variable ans = A
Iterate from i = 0 to i = B - 1. If ith bit was set in A that is (A & (1<<i)) != 0, ans -= (1<<i), unset it from the answer.
