Make answer  of prefix sum in same aaray
dont create extra space
public class Solution {
    public int[] solve(int[] A) {
       
             
        for(int i = 1;i<A.length;i++){

          A[i] = A[i-1] + A[i];
        }
        return A;
    }
}
We will traverse from left to right of the array.
For the leftmost element, we leave it as it as, and 
for the other elements we add to the element on the 
left to it. This will form the prefix sum array

Time Complexity : O(N)
Space Complexity : O(1)
