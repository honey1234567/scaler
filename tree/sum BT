Given a binary tree. Check whether the given tree is a Sum-binary Tree or not.

Sum-binary Tree is a Binary Tree where the value of a every node is equal to sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree.

An empty tree is Sum-binary Tree and sum of an empty tree can be considered as 0. A leaf node is also considered as SumTree.

Return 1 if it sum-binary tree else return 0.



public class Solution {

    int flag = 1;
    
public int solve(TreeNode A) {
        if(A.left==null && A.right==null){return 0;}
        long sum2 = smbtree(A);
        return flag;
    }

    public long smbtree(TreeNode A){
        if(A==null) return 0;
        if(A.left==null && A.right ==null) return A.val;
          
       long ls = smbtree(A.left);
       long rs = smbtree(A.right);
       
       if(A.val != ls + rs) flag = 0;

       return ls+rs+A.val;
        
    }
}
