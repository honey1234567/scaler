Given a number A. Return 1 if A is prime and return 0 if not. 

Note : 
The value of A can cross the range of Integer.
range of int is till 10^9
1 <= A <= 1012
When is a number, Prime?  
1. When a number is not divisible by any integer other than 1 and itself.
OR
2. When number of factor count for any number is exactly 2.
When searching for prime numbers, be careful of overflows in the problem.Use appropriate typecasting or datatypes.

Prime Number : If Number is divisible by 1 and itself where (N > 2) then number is Prime Number. 

1. If Number is 1, it is not prime because 1 is not a prime number. 

2. Now, for any number A, if is divisible by any number between 2 to A-1, that means it is not a prime number 

3. But instead iteration from 2 to A-1, we will iterate from 2 to sqrt(A) [Think why?]. 

4. While we are iterating, if at any moment a number can divide A, that means A is not a prime number. 

5. After successful Iteration we can say number A is prime Number
