https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/find-minimum-number-of-coins/-greedy algo can fail sometime ex if coins are 1,2,6,5,9 and u need to take sum of 11 then greedy will select 9 and 2 but min is 6  and 5
so DP usese all approach

https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/number-of-islands/-here we are considering all 8 nighbours if u want to go only hiz and vertical ngbr then use this
 while(!q.isEmpty()) {
          int row = q.peek().first; 
          int col = q.peek().second; 
          q.remove(); 

            int delRow[]={-1,1,0,0};
        int delCol[]={0,0,1,-1};
          // traverse in the neighbours and mark them if its a land 
        for(int i=0;i<4;i++){
             
                  int nrow = row + delRow[i]; 
                  int ncol = col + delCol[i]; 
          // check if neighbour row and column is valid, and is an unvisited land
                  if(nrow >= 0 && nrow < n && ncol >= 0 && ncol < m 
                  && grid[nrow][ncol] == '1' && vis[nrow][ncol] == 0) {
                      vis[nrow][ncol] = 1; 
                      q.add(new Pair(nrow, ncol)); 
                  }
              }
          
      }
